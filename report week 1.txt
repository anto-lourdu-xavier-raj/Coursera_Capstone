In this project we are going to examine the dataset ‘Collisions—All Years’ provided in the Coursera week 1 , In this data all the car accidents occured in past till today are mention which are collected from  SPD and recorded by Traffic Records, it has 38 attributes and 5012 entries with location of the accident cause of  the accident damage caused by the collision and many more use full features which can be analyzed to prevent a same type of collision that happened in past . Such as if we find out that at same place there are 2 or 3 collisions due to sloppy road we can put caution boards on that place to prevent future collisions .Another case is that if we find out that any of the collisions occurred due to blind turns on the road we can also prevent them by cautionary boards an blind turn mirrors and a lot can be done if we use proper approach of analyzing and  visualizing data 

We can train a Machine learning mode on the given data to predict the accident damage to send know the severity of the situation to take particular actions
